It is said that the winds are streams of mana themselves, and thus to control them, one would have to read the flow of energy around them like the waves of the ocean. Many who practise this esoteric form of magic are blind or crippled, yet have the wisdom and awareness of everyday man. Perhaps the wind speaks to them, or they have simply learned to walk with the current. </p>

                    <p class="card-text">"Arcane Magic is the archetype of magic which is fueled by The Void, or more specifically mana. The Void is an empty plane of existence where things may be created with the use of ones imagination and willpower. Many teachers of the Arcane often teach students with the following proverb: "The Void is nothing, yet everything. Like our imagination, it may be dull and empty; or it can be full and colorful". The Void as a whole is simply a plane where nothing exists, unless the mage makes it exist. In invoking this pure form of magic, one may be more effective in dealing with otherwordly beings, though struggle against common plate and steel.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Blood was thought to be life. Flesh belonged to us, the blood to deity or deities.Blood Magic is, at it’s core, the magical art of drawing power (mana) from the blood of any living being, be it yourself or any other. Use of the magic sacrifices vitality and “life” in exchange for increased power and a temporarily deeper mana pool (explained below).<br />
                        <br /> It can be used to cast or enhance spells as well as cast some spells of it’s own at later stages, although it’s used most efficiently in the performance of powerful rituals that would otherwise be far too draining and taxing for even some of the most powerful Arcane mages. During the process of drawing the power from the blood, the natural energy is twisted and morphed, creating an unnatural and crude form of it’s original state.</p>
